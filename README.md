# 🛍️ Retail Demand Forecasting using Spark + Streamlit

This project implements a big data pipeline for **retail demand forecasting** using PySpark and MLlib, and visualizes results using Streamlit. It forecasts product-level monthly sales and analyzes holiday-driven demand shifts.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

This pipeline processes over **1 million transaction records**, filters, aggregates, models, and visualizes them. It’s designed for scalability, interpretability, and modularity.

### 💡 Problem Statement

> Predict future product-level demand to support better inventory management and uncover sales patterns around holidays and seasons.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- `PySpark` – ETL, feature engineering, MLlib modeling  
- `Pandas` – helper logic for EDA and visualization  
- `Streamlit` – interactive visualization dashboard  
- `Docker` – reproducible environment for all components

## 🧪 Pipeline Steps

1. **EDA & Cleaning**

   * Removes returns/cancellations
   * Drops null `CustomerID`, invalid quantities/prices

2. **Aggregation**

   * Monthly product-level aggregation
   * Focus on top-selling SKUs

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Lags (prev month), rolling avg (3m), time flags
   * Public holiday flag from UK dataset

4. **Modeling**

   * RandomForestRegressor via PySpark MLlib
   * Grid-tuned `numTrees` and `maxDepth`
   * Validation set used for hyperparameter selection

5. **Seasonal & Holiday Analysis**

   * Holiday-driven product insights
   * Quarterly seasonality
   * New Year vs. Christmas comparison

---

## 📈 Dashboard (Streamlit)

Launch with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Key Sections:

* **📊 Model Summary**

  * RMSE, MAE, Best Parameters
* **🔮 Forecast Explorer**

  * Actual vs Predicted
  * Filter by product
* **🎁 Holiday Products**

  * Bar chart: top SKUs during public holidays
* **📆 Quarterly Trends**

  * Avg sales per product by Q1–Q4
* **🎄 Holiday Comparison**

  * Dec vs Jan sales for seasonal items
* **🏆 Holiday Impact**

  * Which holidays align with highest sales?

---

## 🧪 Example: `model_metrics.json`

```json
{
  "RMSE": 3087.35,
  "MAE": 2285.26,
  "Best Hyperparameters": {
    "numTrees": 20,
    "maxDepth": 10
  }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

* Products like **Christmas kits and buntings** peak in Nov/Dec
* **Substitute holidays** (e.g., post-Boxing Day) drive more revenue than Christmas itself
* Holiday-aware features didn’t reduce error significantly, but added interpretability
* Model performs best on stable SKUs and struggles with seasonal volatility
